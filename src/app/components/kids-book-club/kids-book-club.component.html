          This is a book club where we read kid's book and have a Very Serious
          Debate over them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to join, check the list below for the next Kid's Book Club
          Debate. Read the next book and attend the debate, or contact us if you
          want to work with a team captain to be more involved!
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone starts out the debate on either side of the issue, or
          neutral. All sides will have a captain who will make a presentation
          for their side. Anyone will be able to make arguments. During the
          debate everyone but the captain can switch sides. Whichever side has
          most people at the end wins!
